This a Python GUI application designed to help users create and manage Electronic Program Guide (EPG) schedules for TV channels. Here’s what it’s meant to achieve:
**Purpose and Functionality**
User Interface for EPG Creation:
It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, allowing users to easily input, edit, and manage TV program schedules without needing to write code.

Bulk Data Entry:
Users can paste tabular schedule data (with start time, end time, title, and icon URL) for each day of the week. The app parses this data and organizes it internally.

Flexible Scheduling:
Users specify start date, number of weeks, and channel name. The tool will generate a schedule covering the specified period, duplicating weekly patterns as needed.

Export to Excel and XML:
The app generates two output files:

Excel (.xlsx): For easy human-readable editing and viewing.
XML: Specifically formatted for EPG systems, with correct time formatting and inclusion of icons and descriptions.
Data Validation and Feedback:
It checks for missing data (e.g., if any days are unscheduled), provides user feedback, and helps prevent export errors.

Customization and Reset:
Users can reset all fields, browse for output file locations, and exit via the GUI.

Typical Use Case
This tool is useful for TV channel operators, content managers, or anyone needing to create and manage EPG schedules, especially when the schedule repeats weekly and requires both human-editable (Excel) and machine-readable (XML) outputs.
